## The one principle

> **The framework owns methodology. The repository owns truth.**

Everything else in this repository is a consequence of that sentence.

**Methodology** is how work is done: the order of the stages, what a risk tier
implies, what counts as evidence, which operations a human owns, how a finding
must be evidenced before it is reported. It is the same in a payments API and a
static site generator, which is why it can be centralised.

**Truth** is what a particular system *is*: its language, its layering, its
data model, its authorization mechanism, its deployment target, its non-obvious
invariants. It is different in every repository and changes underneath you,
which is why it cannot be centralised — and why every attempt to do so produces
a framework that confidently describes an architecture nobody has.

## The failure this prevents

The framework this one was extracted from lived inside a single API repository.
It was excellent there, because its agents knew that repository's exact
contracts by name. Copying that directory into a second repository would have
produced a review measuring the new code against the old one's architecture —
fluent, specific, and wrong in a way that is very hard to notice.

That failure mode is the whole design constraint. A framework used across a
hundred repositories must be **structurally incapable** of asserting a stack.

## How the split is enforced

Documentation is not enforcement. Four mechanisms make the split real:

### 1. The evidence protocol

`standards/repository-evidence.md` is read by every agent before it does
anything. It fixes a source precedence — code over tests over CI over
documentation over ticket wording over the model's own priors — and requires
every claim to be labelled **FACT** (with a `path:line` actually opened),
**INFERENCE**, **ASSUMPTION** or **UNKNOWN**.

An `UNKNOWN` is a result. That is the load-bearing part: the alternative to
inventing an answer has to be a legitimate output, or it will not be chosen.

### 2. Agents that ask instead of assert

Every agent begins by *locating* the mechanism it reviews. The security agent
does not check "is CASL used correctly"; it asks "where is record-level access
enforced in this repository, and what happens if I cannot find it?"

The questions generalise losslessly. The answers never do.

### 3. A mechanical denylist

`tests/validate-plugin.mjs` scans every skill, agent, standard and template for
the name of any specific framework, ORM, database, queue or tool. A match fails
CI.

This is the check that makes the principle survive contact with a hurried
contributor. Prose saying "stay stack-agnostic" is a wish; a failing build is a
constraint. It is verified non-vacuous: injecting a product name into a
standard fails the build.

### 4. Repository-owned extension points

Anything genuinely stack-specific has a place to live that is *not* the
framework: the repository's own `CLAUDE.md` and its own `.claude/skills/`.

The framework never competes with those. It cites them.

The extension points that remain are the ones the *gates* read, and
both are sections of `CLAUDE.md` rather than keys in a file of the framework's
own design: the **canonical commands** table tells the validation gate what to
run instead of inferring, and the **High-risk paths** section tells the design
and review gates which changes deserve more ceremony. Both are advisory guidance
to an agent. Neither blocks anything, and no document may describe them as
though they do.

They live in `CLAUDE.md` and nowhere else. A separate configuration file for
them is the design this one rejects, for three reasons that generalise:

- **A `commands` key is a second copy of the `CLAUDE.md` command table.**
  Stating a contract twice is the drift this project's conventions forbid
  everywhere else.
- **A declared `frameworkVersion` is a synchronisation problem the framework
  would be inventing for itself.** Claude Code owns the installed version. A
  number in the consuming repository can only agree with it or go quietly
  stale.
- **High-risk paths state something true about *this repository*** — which is
  the definition of what `CLAUDE.md` is for.

### 4a. The one thing the framework writes into a repository

`framework-install` merges three things into the project's own
`.claude/settings.json` — `extraKnownMarketplaces`, `enabledPlugins`, and the
single `env` member `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS` that makes a run's stages
visible in the task panel — so the repository declares its dependency on this
framework the way it declares any other, and Claude Code owns everything downstream of that: trust, installation,
the installed version, the cache, updates.

The boundary is narrow on purpose, and it is the same boundary 1.0.0 drew:

| The framework writes | The framework never writes |
|---|---|
| `extraKnownMarketplaces.<marketplace>` | `permissions`, in any scope |
| `enabledPlugins["<plugin>@<marketplace>"]` | `hooks`, `env`, or any other key |
| — in the project's own settings only | `~/.claude/settings.json`, or anything under `~/.claude/plugins/` |
| `autoUpdate: true`, on a new entry only | an existing entry's stated `autoUpdate` |

**Declaring a dependency is not the same act as rewriting a permission
posture.** The first is what a package manifest does; the second is what the
a permissions floor does, and it is what stays banned. That distinction
is the whole justification for the exception, so it is asserted mechanically in
`tests/validate-install-settings.mjs` — including a case proving a run writes
nothing into `$HOME` — rather than promised in this document.

### 4b. Why `autoUpdate` is part of the declaration

A new marketplace entry is written with `"autoUpdate": true`. This is the
authoritative explanation; everywhere else refers here rather than restating it,
and [constraints C20](constraints.md) carries the platform citations.

**The principle: this is development tooling, not an application runtime
dependency.** A framework release changes the instructions, skills, review
discipline, validation behaviour and efficiency policy Claude brings to *future*
engineering work. It does not modify deployed application code, update
application dependencies, change a production runtime, deploy anything, or
bypass repository review, tests or CI. The blast radius of a bad framework
release is "the next change is designed or reviewed differently", not "production
moved" — and that is a categorically smaller risk than the one people are
imagining when they reach for a version pin.

Auto-update is therefore on by default, so developers spend their attention on
shipping product value rather than tracking framework releases. Teams that need
controlled adoption opt out; see *What holds the line* below.

**It also follows from removing the version pin.** Before 2.0.0 a consuming
repository declared `frameworkVersion`, and `himoa-doctor` failed on a major gap —
crude, but a stale installation eventually announced itself. Nothing replaced
it: a repository now records **no framework version at all**. Updating is still
entirely possible — `/plugin marketplace update` then `/plugin update`, any
time — but nothing asks for it and nothing reports that a newer version exists.
So a team installs once and stays on that version until somebody deliberately
decides otherwise, and a corrected standard reaches them only then. The gap is
silent from both ends, which is this framework's characteristic failure.

**The alternatives were worse for the people they affect.** The documented
alternatives are a per-machine toggle in `/plugin` and an administrator setting
in *managed* settings. Neither is available to a public marketplace distributing
to strangers, and both amount to asking every developer to maintain a plugin they
did not choose to think about.

**What it explicitly does not relax.** An updated framework still runs the same
pipeline at the same floor: mapping, design, human approval, implementation,
review, validation, presentation, scaled by risk and scope. *Adaptive rigor,
fixed quality floor* is unchanged by how the plugin arrived on disk, and no part
of auto-update touches the gates, the evidence language, or the human-owned
operations. Receiving a release never means the next change gets less scrutiny —
only that the scrutiny is current.

**What it costs, and where that cost is carried.** The version bump in
`plugin.json` becomes the only brake between a changed standard and everyone who
has this key. That is not a footnote — [versioning](versioning.md) is written
around it, and it is why a standard change is a release decision here rather than
a merge decision.

**And it is not purely project-scoped**, which is measured rather than assumed:
Claude Code keeps marketplace state *"once per user in
`~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`, not per project"*, and a committed
project value reaches it. So the key is written **loudly** — the installer
reports what it set and what that commits the team to, on every run, rather than
slipping it into a diff.

**What holds the line.** `--no-auto-update` opts out. An entry that already
*states* `autoUpdate`, `true` or `false`, is never rewritten — the installer
completes a declaration that has no opinion and does not reverse one that does,
using `has("autoUpdate")` rather than a truthiness test, because `false` is a
decision and a truthiness test cannot tell it from absent.
`validate-plugin.mjs` fails if the shipped declaration loses the key;
`validate-install-settings.mjs` fails if a fresh install omits it, if
`--no-auto-update` writes it anyway, or if an existing `false` is flipped.

The distinction from a permission rule still holds: this changes *when this
plugin updates itself*, which is a property of the dependency the repository
declared. It grants no tool access and blocks no operation.

### 5. A vocabulary that can say "this repository does not have that"

The labels include **ABSENT** alongside **UNKNOWN**, and the evidence verdicts
include **`N/A`** alongside `BLOCKED`.

That distinction carries more weight than it looks like it should. Without it,
a repository with no linter, no tenancy model and no migrations produces a map
full of unknowns and a validation verdict that can never reach `PASS` — so the
framework treats an ordinary small repository as a defective one, and the gate
becomes an obstacle rather than a signal. The first thing anyone does with an
obstacle is route around it.

`ABSENT` is a fact about the system. `UNKNOWN` is a gap in the investigation.
Only the second is a problem.

## The three tiers

```

Tier 1 exists today. Tier 3 is what you write. **Tier 2 deliberately does not
exist yet** — see [Extension model](#extension-model).

Precedence runs upward: tier 3 beats tier 2 beats tier 1. A framework standard
that contradicts a repository's own documented contract loses, every time, and
the standards say so in their own text.

## Component map

```

`standards/` and `templates/` are not Claude Code component directories. They
are plain files, cited by `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` from the skills and agents
that need them — which is exactly the point: **nothing loads until something
needs it.**

## Context economy

The framework runs on every request in every repository, so its always-on cost
is a first-class design constraint.

| Loaded | When | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Session charter | Every session, via a `SessionStart` hook | ~75 lines, capped at 80 |
| Skill listing entries | Always | Four model-invoked descriptions |
| A gate `SKILL.md` | When the human invokes that gate | One file |
| A standard | When a gate or agent cites it | One file |
| A template | When a gate reaches the section that uses it | One file |
| An agent prompt | In that agent's own context, not yours | Isolated |
| The runtime execution contract | Embedded in every agent, already loaded | No tool call |

That last row is the correction to the one above it. "A standard, when a gate or
agent cites it, one file" was true of a gate and false of an agent: every
reasoning agent opened with an ordered list of three to six framework documents,
the first of which pointed at a fourth. See
[Specification and runtime contract](#specification-and-runtime-contract).

The conductor deliberately does **not** front-load the gate skills. Five gates
is over a thousand lines, four of which would be read long before they matter.
Loading on demand is the entire reason the gates are separate files.

The same principle governs the *repository*, and that is the larger cost by far.
A gate skill is one file; a repository sweep is unbounded. See
[Adaptive rigor, fixed quality floor](#adaptive-rigor-fixed-quality-floor).

The `SessionStart` hook is used because a `CLAUDE.md` at a plugin root is not
loaded as project context — plugins contribute context through skills, agents
and hooks. See [constraints](constraints.md).

## Why the human gates are structural

Two boundaries are enforced by mechanism, not by instruction:

**A design cannot approve itself.** `gate-approve` sets
`disable-model-invocation: true`, which removes it from Claude's context
entirely. There is no phrasing that causes Claude to invoke it. Under the
conductor, approval instead comes from a plan-mode decision — a real user
action, recorded before the first edit into a run state file kept outside the
consuming repository so it survives compaction, and onto the implementation task
as well when the session has task tools at all. A summary claiming "the user
approved" is not evidence, and `gate-implement` says so explicitly.

That record used to live only on the task, which is the shape of defect
[C21](constraints.md#c21--the-task-list-tools-are-not-provided-by-default-on-current-models)
describes: a host application withdrew the tool by default, the write became a
no-op, and the guarantee was gone with nothing in this repository able to see
it. A boundary that depends on an optional feature of the host is enforced by
instruction after all.

**The commit is the human's.** Git writes are denied at two layers, and the
work is reported as existing only in the working tree.

Everything else — moving between implement, review and validate — is *not* a
gate. Prompting there converts one authorisation into four confirmations of a
decision already made, which trains people to click through the prompts that
do matter.

## Why review independence is preserved differently in each mode

Whoever reviews a diff should not be the context that just wrote it.

**Standalone** preserves that by recommending a fresh session before reviewing
High or Critical work.

**Conductor** cannot pause, so it preserves it structurally: on High or
Critical work the review *must* fan out to independent read-only subagents,
each starting from a clean context and reading the diff from disk, and *must*
run the adversarial refutation pass on every serious finding.

A conductor that reviews High-risk work by itself has skipped the gate, not
accelerated it. That sentence appears in three files on purpose.

## Adversarial verification

The context that produced a finding is the worst available judge of whether it
is real. For Critical and High findings on High and Critical changes, an
independent agent is asked to **refute** the finding, defaulting to refuted
when the evidence is ambiguous.

Refuted findings are dropped and recorded with their refutation. Surviving
findings carry the refutation attempt on the record — which is what makes the
severity credible to whoever reads it later.

It is not run below that threshold: the cycle costs more than the precision it
buys.

Beneath it, at every tier, **a finding is a claim, not a fact**. The conductor
re-opens the cited source and each candidate leaves as confirmed, rejected with
the evidence, or unresolved with what would settle it. Remediation starts only
from a confirmed finding; an unresolved one is escalated or reported, never
fixed to be safe — a change made against a claim nobody could confirm is an
unreviewed change with a reviewer's name on it. The same gate names the two
questions a review answers: *did we build the approved thing*, which the
conductor owns as the whole-change checks, and *did we build it correctly*,
which the lenses answer. Below Critical one pass answers both; on Critical the
`architect` lens's declared area already includes plan conformance, so that
tier gets an independent second answer without a second reviewer per ticket.

## Diagnosis before remediation

A defect is a work item like any other, and one kind of failure is specific to
it: a fix designed from a plausible cause. It reads as correct, its tests pass,
the review sees a tidy diff, and nothing after the design can tell it from a
fix for the demonstrated cause. So the proof has to exist before the design
does.

`skills/domain-debugging` carries that, as a model-invoked playbook in the same
shape as the other three: it loads itself when the work is a bug, a regression,
a failing test, unexpected or intermittent behaviour, an integration failure or
a performance regression — including in ad-hoc sessions that never invoke a
gate, which is where most debugging happens. It fixes the order — reproduce,
gather the evidence, trace, hypothesis, prove or disprove, root cause, then the
fix with its regression test — and labels the cause like any other claim.
`FACT` or `INFERENCE` supports a fix design; `UNKNOWN` is read back at approval
so the human decides whether a mitigation ships, and it is called one.

Rigor scales with the defect's shape, not the size of the fix. A deterministic
failure whose cause is on the failing line takes the `Direct` exit — the
reproduction is the proof, and a written-up hypothesis for a typo is the
ceremony the exit exists to prevent. An intermittent, concurrent,
cross-component, data-corrupting or security-relevant defect owes a reproduction
or a stated reason none is possible, the value at each boundary, and a
hypothesis whose prediction was observed — never one whose fix made the symptom
stop. The playbook adds no stage: the diagnosis is Stage 1's understanding, the
fix is Stage 2's design, and review and validation run unchanged at the tier of
the code the fix touches.

## A ticket is a goal, and it is written by a different stage

The framework ranks a ticket at the bottom of its evidence order and reads its
acceptance criteria as a proposed method, because that is what a ticket is:
one person's account of an outcome and their guess at how to reach it. That
position is what lets `gate-design` build the smallest thing that delivers the
goal rather than the thing the ticket happened to describe.

It also means the framework's own ticket writing has to respect it. Asked to
create a ticket, the default is to map the repository and write down the
design — which produces a good plan, at the wrong stage, for a reader who has
not approved it, and which the design stage then grades down and re-derives.
`skills/write-ticket` carries the correction: a human-invoked mode, iterated
across turns, that writes the story, the current behaviour as cited fact, the
outcomes that would prove delivery and the questions still open — and puts
every mechanism anyone proposes under a non-binding heading. Its template names
what each section becomes downstream, so a ticket written there arrives at
`work-item` already in the shape Stage 1 extracts. That shape is one input
among many and is never required: a tracker issue, a pasted paragraph or a
single sentence is the ordinary case, and the stages downstream were written
for it. The rules they already apply to any input — the split, the grades, the
refusal to decide a product question silently — are what make the shape land.

One section is the exception, and it is the one the ticket opens with. An
outcome whose order is part of it gets a **process flow**: numbered steps, each an event
someone outside the system can observe. It exists because the ticket has two
readers — the agent that implements it and the developer who steers that
agent until the work is done — and a multi-step outcome stated only as a story
and criteria can be correct on every line and still deliver the wrong
integration, because the order was nowhere. `standards/repository-evidence.md`
§5 states once why that is a requirement and not a design: an ordered list of
observable events is the goal; an ordered list of edits is a plan for it.
Because the order is the requirement, the stages downstream do read it —
`gate-design` §1 treats it as the outline of the requirement, the plan traces
its tests to its steps, the validation report says which steps have evidence,
and the consumer handoff opens with the contract's interaction sequence
(`templates/contract-change.md` §1b), from which a consumer ticket's flow is
derived. A flow is never required of the input: when it is absent, the design
stage states the flow the requirement implies in the plan's §1 and carries on.

The mode is deliberately not a pipeline. There is no ledger and no state file:
the whole substantive ticket is re-emitted every turn — every criterion, every
exclusion, every open question, with the sections that have nothing in them
left out rather than written as "none" — so the last message is the state,
and a draft too long for that is a ticket that needs splitting. How much the
skill reads and asks is `standards/execution-efficiency.md` applied to a
ticket, not a policy of its own: the read starts narrow, widens only when
evidence reveals an uncertainty that could change the ticket — its actor,
scope, criteria, contract or whether it splits — and contracts once the
human resolves it. Effort stays at high like every component that judges;
what adapts is the spend, and no one selects a depth. It holds a few lines
that each correct a thoroughness that is actually a defect: an actor is grounded by
the code or named by the human and is never invented; readiness is a judgement
about whether the outcome has edges, never an estimate; a criterion is split
by what can be verified apart rather than by the word "and"; a negative is
written where the request or the code makes a boundary real, not for every
positive line. The skill is pinned read-only in CI for the same reason
`gate-design` is — a ticket that can write into the repository has started
implementing the design it exists not to contain.

## Adaptive rigor, fixed quality floor

`standards/execution-efficiency.md` is the single source for how much
computation a stage spends. It exists because the framework had exactly one
answer to "how deeply should this be investigated?" — *comprehensively* — and
paid it on a comment fix and a tenancy change alike.

**This is not a cheap mode.** The floor does not move:

> Efficiency may never reduce the evidence, validation, testing, review
> independence or review depth required to establish correctness for the
> classified risk level.

What adapts is everything above that line. Mapping runs in one of four depth
bands; review lenses are launched because the diff intersects their concern; a
model may be chosen per launch. What is spent is the **minimum sufficient
computation to establish production-grade confidence for the actual risk and
scope** — which is a different number from the lowest token count, and only one
of the two is safe to optimise for.

### Risk governs investigation, not only ceremony

The risk tier decides both what a change must *produce* — a plan, a threat
model, negative tests, a wider review panel — and what it is investigated
*with*. Both directions matter: a Low change does not pay for a system-wide
map, and a High change cannot buy its way out of one by having a small diff.

### Convergence — why an agent stops

An agent's turn ceiling is a runaway backstop, and it gives no warning: it stops
a delegated agent where it stands, with no turn in which to write anything up.
So an agent that treats investigation as the task reaches the ceiling and
returns **nothing** — the one outcome that produces no evidence at all, and the
one observed in practice.

§8 of that standard is the answer, and it is deliberately not a turn count.
Convergence is a property of the evidence: before each further step, name what
its result could change — a finding, the classification, the implementation
shape, an authorization or persistence or contract conclusion, a required test,
or an `UNKNOWN` that would otherwise stand. If it could change none of them, the
answer is already held. Widening under §4 outranks that test outright, so it
never argues against following evidence.

Two things make it operational rather than aspirational. **Synthesis is part of
the task**, so the report is owed from the first turn rather than attempted
afterwards — and every agent has a sanctioned shape for a bounded one, so
returning verified findings plus explicit `UNKNOWN`s is a legitimate output
rather than an admission. **A brief names the decision the agent owns** and
hands over locations rather than conclusions, because an agent briefed at a
repository rather than at a decision has no stopping point to converge on, and
because a specialist handed the parent's verdict on its own concern has lost the
independence the launch was paying for.

The brief carries **minimum sufficient context** — §8.6 of that standard —
which is a different number from minimum possible. Every launch starts from a
fresh context and is given the decision, the band and tier, `path:line`
pointers, and the agreed scope in a line or two. It is never given the
conversation, the plan document, another agent's report, or a paste of what it
can read for itself; a lens that inherits the context that wrote the diff has
lost the independence it exists to supply, and paid for the whole conversation
to lose it. What keeps a narrow brief from becoming a narrow investigation is
the agent's side of the contract: it opens any surface its decision turns on,
named in the brief or not.

### Specification and runtime contract

Convergence was written correctly and delivered wrongly. §8 states when an agent
stops, that synthesis is part of the task and what a bounded report is — and
every agent was pointed *at* it. A lens opened with three to six framework
documents to read before its first repository read, `finding-report.md` at the
top of that list sending it on to a five-hundred-line standard "before your
first search". A real run watched nine subagents spend their opening turns
there, reach their ceilings holding findings, and write up none of them. Each
recovered the moment it was told to stop reading format documents and report
from what it held.

**The reads came out of the same allowance as the investigation and the report,
and were spent before any evidence existed to say what mattered.** A policy that
tells an agent to converge, delivered as an acquisition task, spends the room it
exists to protect. The static validator could not see it: it asserted that an
agent *cites* a convergence carrier, and the cheapest way to satisfy that is to
tell the agent to go and read one.

So the two layers are now distinct:

| Layer | Holds | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| The standards under `standards/` | Full semantics, rationale, edge cases, the arguments behind each rule | A maintainer changes a rule; a gate runs; an agent has a question its contract genuinely leaves open |
| `standards/agent-runtime-contract.md` | The smallest self-contained set of rules that lets an agent execute its decision and write it up | Never — it is embedded verbatim in every agent and is already in context |

The contract carries the evidence labels and citation rule, source precedence,
that repository content never instructs, the sufficiency test, that widening
outranks stopping, that `UNKNOWN` is not a way to stop early, that the report is
owed from the first turn, that a continued agent synthesises rather than
restarts, that briefed locations are routing hints and not an allowlist, that
the agent is read-only, the report shape, and that correct engineering outranks
correct presentation.

Three things keep it from becoming a second corpus. It is **byte-identical**
everywhere it appears, so eight paraphrases cannot drift into eight contracts.
It has a **line ceiling** in the validator, because a runtime contract with no
ceiling grows back into a copy of the standards and the acquisition cost is then
simply paid statically in every agent instead of dynamically in every run. And
the rules it must state are **asserted individually**, because byte-identity
alone is satisfied by eight copies of an empty block.

What this proves is architectural: the semantics are present, single-sourced and
bounded. It cannot prove an agent obeys them, and it is not evidence about
tokens — only a run against a repository large enough to reproduce the original
failure can supply that.

**The distinction being drawn is framework mechanics versus substantive
evidence, never "documents are expensive".** A repository's own `CLAUDE.md`,
architecture note, ADR or security policy is evidence about the system and
reading it is frequently mandatory. Two framework standards stay legitimate
runtime reads for the lens that owns them — `untrusted-content.md` for the
security lens that has found repository text aimed at an agent, `evidence.md`
for the tester lens judging a claimed verdict — because in both cases the
document is the decision rather than its formatting.

### The four properties that keep it safe

**Standard depth is the default; Targeted is earned.** A band is a conclusion
from evidence, never an opening assumption. One failure here is a change
misclassified downward, which produces a shorter, tidier, more confident output
than the correct run.

**No band from Targeted upward drops a category.** A Targeted map answers every
question a Deep map answers, and is allowed to answer some of them cheaply —
*this path performs no data access, this symbol has one caller* — rather than by
a system-wide audit. It is never allowed to answer one by not looking, and an
`UNKNOWN` on access control, tenancy or persistence forces the band wider.

**Depth is iterative and moves one way once it has started.** Evidence widens a
band and raises a tier; nothing lowers either afterwards, and neither the
eventual size of the diff nor how far along the work is counts as evidence that
it should be.

**And below all of it there is `Direct`.** A comment fix, a log line or a
one-liner whose cause and effect are both already visible gets the lines changed
and the symbol they sit in — no map, and none owed. It is the one band entered
from the shape of the request rather than concluded from a map, because a band
you have to map to justify is not a band; the safety is the entry condition and
the exit rather than a prior sweep, and any §4 trigger or unanswerable §3.1
question sends the change to `Targeted`.

It exists because the first three properties address only one of the two
failures. Overspending is not merely an aesthetic cost: it is charged to the
same person every time, on the work least able to absorb it, and the endpoint is
that they stop routing anything through the framework. **A framework routed
around protects nothing**, so the ceremony a High-risk change gets is only
affordable if a trivial change does not get it too.

### What is left on the table, and why

Reasoning effort is fixed per component and cannot be varied per launch, so the
obvious *effort scales with tier* design is not expressible — see
[C17](constraints.md#c17--reasoning-effort-cannot-be-varied-per-launch). Turn
ceilings are hard stops rather than budgets, so lowering them truncates the
deepest investigation while saving nothing on the short ones —
[C18](constraints.md#c18--maxturns-is-a-hard-stop-and-therefore-not-a-budget).
Both limitations are recorded rather than papered over with prose that would
claim a control the framework does not have.

## Resuming approved work

A pipeline that stops for human approval and then runs unattended will be
interrupted. `standards/resumption.md` is the single source for what happens
next, and its shape follows from splitting one word into three problems —
[C22](constraints.md#c22--the-host-restores-a-resumed-session-in-full-and-assesses-no-drift).

| Problem | Whose | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| Recovering the conversation, the tool calls and their results | The host's | `--resume` restores the full transcript. The framework stores nothing |
| Holding the run's position when the conversation is summarised away | Already solved | The run state file and the ledger, for the reasons in [C21](constraints.md#c21--the-task-list-tools-are-not-provided-by-default-on-current-models) |
| Whether the approved state is **still valid** against the repository now | The framework's | The drift assessment |

**The framework built only the third**, and built it as prose and normative
anchors rather than as machinery. There is no new store: the run state file
already existed and already lived outside the working tree, which is what makes
the usual worries about operational state — a stray file in a commit, a
collision with a repository's own `.claude/`, a `.gitignore` the framework
writes into somebody else's repository — unreachable here rather than merely
mitigated.

**Three properties do the work.**

*Saved state never outranks current repository evidence.* A resumed run reads
its state, establishes the repository as it is now, compares, and only then
decides. It re-reads the source for anything correctness depends on, because
the state's account of the code is a summary and the code is still there.

*Drift is semantic.* That the commit changed is not a finding. What is compared
is what changed against what the approved work rests on — its cited evidence,
the files it meant to change, the surfaces it declared affected. A README typo
is `SAFE TO RESUME`; a rewritten authorization check is `REVALIDATE DESIGN`;
being unable to tell is `BLOCKED`. A rule that invalidated every resumed run
would be ignored within a week, which is why the cheap version was not built.

*An approval is only ever the human's own words.* It survives compaction and it
survives resuming, carried by a verbatim trace — and by nothing else. No trace,
an ambiguous one, an unreadable state file, or drift touching what was approved
all resolve the same way: `RE-APPROVAL REQUIRED`. The state file is untrusted
input on resume like any other file read back into a later session, including
one this framework wrote itself.

Resumability is not a step a normal work item performs. A run that is never
interrupted opens its state file as it already did and never loads this
standard at all.

## Extension model

Stack knowledge belongs in **its own plugin in the same marketplace**, not in
this one:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "some-stack-pack",
  "source": "./some-stack-pack",
  "dependencies": ["himoa"]
}
```

Its skills carry a `when_to_use` that requires repository evidence — *"use only
when this repository actually contains X"* — so the pack stays inert in a
repository it does not apply to.

**No stack pack ships today**, deliberately. The first one should be extracted
from a second real repository that needs it, not designed in advance from one.
YAGNI applies to frameworks about engineering discipline exactly as it applies
to everything else.

### The first candidate, recorded rather than built

Adding a second real stack to `fixtures/` surfaced guidance that is genuinely
reusable *and* genuinely stack-specific — the combination that a pack exists
for, and that a generic agent must never absorb:

- Migration tooling that keys applied migrations **by filename** makes editing
  an already-applied migration invisible to every environment that ran it. The
  generic framework can only say "an applied migration deserves the higher risk
  tier", which a repository's High-risk paths already do. Naming the mechanism,
  and the CI shape that catches it, needs the pack.
- **Expand/contract sequencing** where the previous build serves traffic against
  the new schema for the length of the deploy window. The failure is real and
  the remedy is tool-specific.

Neither is written into an agent today, and neither should be. They are recorded
here so the first pack starts from evidence rather than from a blank page.

## What was deliberately left behind

| Left behind | Why |
|---|---|
| Repository-specific playbooks | They cite symbols that exist in one repository. They stay there. |
| **Enforcement of any kind** | A text parser cannot out-guess a shell — an attempt at a permissions floor and tool-call guards produced two Critical and ten High defects under a six-lens review, and every hole patched suggested another. A plugin that rewrites a developer's permission rules also confuses advice with authority. Permissions belong to the repository and its owner. |
| Issue-tracker specifics | Tracker-agnostic and optional. |
| A worktree fan-out for parallel implementation | Deferred in the original design for good reasons that still hold. |
| `permissionMode` on agents | Not supported for plugin-shipped agents. Read-only comes from the tool pool and is asserted in CI. |
