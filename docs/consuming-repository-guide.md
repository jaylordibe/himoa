# Consuming repository guide

What a repository has to provide, and what it gets in return.

## The short version

**One file carries the truth: `AGENTS.md`** — the neutral home every coding
agent reads. For Claude Code, a thin `CLAUDE.md` imports it (`@AGENTS.md`) so
the same single source loads. Everything else has a working default.

Two things have to be in place, and they arrive by different routes. The plugin
lives on your machine and you install it; the repository contract lives in the
repository and arrives with `git pull`.

**Bringing the framework to a repository for the first time** — the plugin, then
the contract:

```text
/plugin marketplace add jaylordibe/himoa
/plugin install himoa@jaylordibe
```

```text
/himoa:framework-install
/himoa:framework-doctor
```

Commit what `framework-install` writes. That is the last time anyone in this
repository runs it.

**Joining a repository a colleague already set up** — you need the plugin only.
**Do not run `framework-install`**: the declaration is already in the commit you
pulled, and re-running it only reports that everything is already correct.

Because the repository declares the marketplace (see [what the declaration looks
like](#what-the-declaration-looks-like)), trusting the folder registers it with
no further prompt, so you skip `/plugin marketplace add`. **You still run the
install yourself:**

```text
/plugin install himoa@jaylordibe
```

Two commands become one, not none — a project declaration enables a plugin, it
never installs one.

Either way, then work:

```text
/himoa:work-item add rate limiting to the password reset endpoint
```

## Using this repository from Codex, Cursor, Copilot or Gemini

This guide describes the Claude Code path (the reference implementation). The
same methodology runs on OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot and Gemini CLI
through their native mechanisms — no second copy of Himoa:

Run the installers from a clone:
`git clone https://github.com/jaylordibe/himoa && himoa/plugins/himoa/bin/himoa-<host>-install`.
Inside a Claude Code session with the plugin enabled, they are also on that
session's `PATH` by name, as below. Nothing here writes outside the paths
shown, and nothing commits on your behalf.

```bash
himoa-codex-install          # Codex: once per machine (skills, read-only reviewers, standards)
himoa-cursor-install         # Cursor: same, sharing the skills/standards install with Codex
himoa-codex-install --repo   # Codex/Cursor: once per repository, create or extend AGENTS.md (never destroys it)
himoa-copilot-install        # Copilot: repo only (AGENTS.md + advisory .github/agents); never $HOME
himoa-gemini-install         # Gemini: ~/.gemini subagents + /himoa:* commands; --repo wires AGENTS.md
himoa-codex-doctor           # verify (himoa-{cursor,copilot,gemini}-doctor per host)
```

`--check` is a dry run; `--uninstall` removes only Himoa-owned files. For
Gemini, `himoa-gemini-install --repo` also points `.gemini/settings.json` at
`AGENTS.md`. Invoke the pipeline as Codex `$himoa-work-item`, Cursor
`/himoa-work-item`, Gemini `/himoa:work-item`.

Copilot is a cloud agent, so its adapter never touches `$HOME`. Commit what it
writes and let Copilot open a pull request:

```bash
himoa-copilot-install
himoa-copilot-doctor
git add AGENTS.md .github/agents && git commit
```

Copilot is **Supported with limitations** — its reviewer lenses are advisory (no
read-only subagent) though human approval is hard (structural PR review). See
[Platform capabilities](platform-capabilities.md).

Repository truth lives in **`AGENTS.md`**, which every agent reads; the
`CLAUDE.md` below is a thin `@AGENTS.md` importer so Claude Code loads the same
single source. Everything in the rest of this guide about *what to declare*
(project, canonical commands, high-risk paths, consumers) applies to that
`AGENTS.md`. Human approval and evidence semantics mean the same on both hosts;
`docs/platform-capabilities.md` states, truthfully, where Codex enforces
something differently. Codex is a **Supported (initial) adapter** — see the
support matrix in the README.

## The repository contract

| Artefact | Required | What it buys you |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | **Yes** | Everything — the repository-truth home every agent reads. Without it, every agent infers your stack. |
| `CLAUDE.md` (a thin `@AGENTS.md` importer) | **Yes, for Claude Code** | Loads that one truth source into Claude Code. Scaffolded next to `AGENTS.md`; holds only Claude-specific notes, never a second copy of the truth. |
| A canonical-commands table in `AGENTS.md` | Recommended | The validation gate runs your commands rather than inferring them |
| A `High-risk paths` section in `AGENTS.md` | Optional | Changes touching those paths get the higher review tier and a deeper map |
| A `Consumers` table in `AGENTS.md` | Recommended | Contract changes that name who breaks |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Recommended | Declares the marketplace and enables the plugin, so colleagues do not configure it by hand. Written by `framework-install` |
| `.claude/skills/` playbooks | Optional (Claude Code) | Where your Claude-specific stack knowledge lives — a Claude Code extension point |

Nothing else. No `tasks/` directory, no plan files, no decision-record
directory, no mandated test framework or language, and **no framework version
anywhere in your repository** — Claude Code owns the installed version.

**The framework still ships no permission rules.** `framework-install` merges
`extraKnownMarketplaces`, `enabledPlugins` and the single `env` member
`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS` into `.claude/settings.json` and nothing else;
it never writes `permissions`, never writes `hooks`, never touches any other
member of `env`, and never writes outside your repository. Any `permissions`
block in that file is yours — nothing here reads it. Delete
`permissions.defaultMode` if one is present: project settings override each
developer's own, so it cancels the permission mode they chose.

### What the declaration looks like

`framework-install` writes this for you. It is shown here so you can review what
lands in the commit:

```jsonc
// .claude/settings.json — committed
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "jaylordibe": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "jaylordibe/himoa" },
      "autoUpdate": true
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "himoa@jaylordibe": true },
  "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS": "1" }
}
```

That is the whole declaration: **which marketplace, that the plugin is enabled
here, that releases arrive on their own, and that a `work-item` run's stages
show up in Claude Code's task panel.** No framework version — that is Claude
Code's to track, not yours.

The last one is there because current models are not given the task tools unless
a session opts in, so without it the panel stays empty for a whole run. It
grants nothing and denies nothing, which is why it is the one environment value
the installer writes. `--no-task-tools` skips it, an existing value is never
rewritten, and a developer who wants it off only for themselves sets it in
`.claude/settings.local.json`, which is not committed.

Anything already in the file is preserved — permissions, hooks, environment,
other marketplaces, other plugins. The installer refuses to write at all if the
file will not parse, if the marketplace name already points somewhere else, or
if someone deliberately set this plugin to `false`.

**This removes one of two setup commands, not both.** Once a colleague trusts
the repository folder, Claude Code registers the marketplace without a further
prompt, so they never run `/plugin marketplace add`.

**They still install the plugin themselves.** From Claude Code v2.1.195, a
plugin that only a project's `.claude/settings.json` enables, and that comes
from an external source such as a git repository, does not load until that
person installs it — Claude Code reports it as not installed and prints the
command to run. `enabledPlugins` makes the plugin active for this repository
once installed; `extraKnownMarketplaces` makes that install resolvable. Neither
performs the install, so onboarding goes from two commands to one rather than to
none.

### Auto-update: on, so nobody on your team chases plugin updates

`autoUpdate` refreshes the marketplace catalogue **and updates the installed
plugin on disk**, in the background after a session starts, so a released
version arrives without anyone running an update command. Third-party
marketplaces default to **off**, which is why the installer writes the key
explicitly.

**Why it is on by default:** the framework is development tooling, not an
application runtime dependency. A release changes how Claude approaches your next
piece of engineering work — not your deployed code, your dependencies, your
production runtime, or your review, test and CI gates. Your team should be
shipping product value rather than tracking framework releases. Full reasoning in
[the architecture](architecture.md); platform detail in
[constraints C20](constraints.md).

The trade, so you decide it rather than inherit it: the framework's version bump
becomes the only thing between a changed standard and this repository.

**To adopt releases deliberately instead**, run the installer with
`--no-auto-update`, or set `"autoUpdate": false` on the entry. The cost is
`/plugin marketplace update jaylordibe` **and**
`/plugin update himoa@jaylordibe` per release.

**Whatever you decide stays decided.** An entry that states `autoUpdate` either
way is never rewritten by a later install.

## 1. Repository truth — `AGENTS.md`

Repository truth lives in **`AGENTS.md`**, the one neutral home every coding
agent reads. Claude Code reads it through a thin `CLAUDE.md` that does
`@AGENTS.md`; Codex, Cursor, Copilot and Gemini read it directly. Start from
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/AGENTS.md.template`, or let `framework-install`
scaffold both files. (An existing `CLAUDE.md`-only repository keeps working
unchanged — the truth can move to `AGENTS.md` when you choose.)

**Do not restate the framework's methodology in it.** The gate sequence, risk
tiers, evidence language and human-owned operations arrive from Himoa. A
second copy drifts, and nothing can detect that it has.

What belongs there is what the framework cannot know:

### Project

One dense paragraph: language, runtime, frameworks, data stores,
authentication model, deployment target, package manager. Agents treat this as
evidence, so **delete anything that is not true** rather than leaving it
aspirational.

### Canonical commands

The validation gate runs these. Every one must work from a clean checkout.

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | |
| Lint | |
| Type check | |
| Unit tests | |
| Integration / end-to-end tests | |

If a command needs a running service first, say so on its row.

**If a command does not exist, omit the row.** The validation gate reports that
gate as `N/A` — not `BLOCKED` — with the evidence that it is genuinely absent.
A repository with no linter is a normal repository, and an absent gate must
never make `PASS` unreachable. Guessing at a command that happens to exit zero
is the one outcome that is actually harmful, because it reads as a pass.

### Architecture

A directory map with one line of purpose per entry. Name the entry points
explicitly; the context mapper starts there.

### Cross-cutting conventions

The rules that apply to almost every change here, **each with the reason it
exists**. A convention without its reason gets "cleaned up" by the next
contributor. Where a rule is enforced by a linter, a type or a test, say so — a
self-enforcing convention is worth more than a documented one.

### Non-obvious invariants

The highest-value section, and the one most often left empty: the things that
look wrong, look deletable, or look simplifiable, and must not be. Each with
the failure it prevents.

### Consumers

Every client that programs against your contracts. This is load-bearing: the
design, implement and review gates all ask "which consumers does this change
force a matching change in?", and an empty table makes the honest answer always
"none".

If there truly are none, write `_(none — internal only)_` **and say why**. An
unfilled table and a deliberately empty one are indistinguishable to every
later reader, and `himoa-doctor` fails while the placeholder is still there.

---

## 2. High-risk paths (optional, and in `AGENTS.md`)

A section in your `AGENTS.md`, not a separate file:

```markdown
## High-risk paths

| Path pattern | Why a change here is High risk |
|---|---|
| `src/auth/*` | Session issuance; a mistake here is silent until it is exploited |
| `src/pricing/*` | Money, and no staging environment that reproduces real plans |
```

A change touching one of these is classified **at least High** whatever the diff
looks like — a full plan, a threat model, negative tests, a wider review panel,
and a deeper repository map before any of it. It is advisory guidance to an
agent: it shapes ceremony, and it blocks no edit and stops no command.

**Keep it short, or delete it.** A list naming half the repository raises the
tier for everything, which is the same as raising it for nothing. Most
repositories are classified correctly from the diff alone.

Add a paragraph after the table for anything that makes the system risky in a
way a reader could not infer from the code — a shared store whose isolation
lives in query builders, a migration tool that keys by filename.

## 3. Repository-specific playbooks (optional, Claude Code)

On Claude Code, your stack knowledge can live in your repository, in
`.claude/skills/`:

```text
.claude/skills/
└── our-resource-pattern/
    └── SKILL.md      # user-invocable: false, with a when_to_use
```

These load alongside the framework's own and are authoritative where they
overlap. The framework's `domain-*` playbooks carry the **questions** for auth,
authorization, background work and defect diagnosis; yours carry **this
repository's answers**.

`.claude/skills/` is a **Claude Code** extension point. Codex, Cursor and
Gemini load skills at machine level (installed by `himoa-<host>-install`), not
from a repository-committed directory — so for knowledge that must travel to
every agent with `git pull`, put it in `AGENTS.md` (its **Deep references**
section points at your own repository playbooks).

---

## Working day to day

```text
/himoa:work-item <requirement>       whole pipeline, two stops
/himoa:gate-design <requirement>     one stage at a time
/himoa:framework-doctor              audit the contract
```

Expect to be stopped for plan approval, and expect the run to end with a diff
in your working tree and nothing committed. Both are the design.

### Writing the ticket first, or one stage at a time

**`/himoa:write-ticket`** drafts a ticket the way a business analyst would — a
user story, the process flow when the order of steps is part of the outcome,
current behaviour cited from your code, observable acceptance criteria,
non-goals and open questions. It contains no design and leaves the risk tier to
the design stage. While a question blocks the ticket, it asks the few that
matter first rather than showing you an unfinished ticket each turn; once they
are resolved it tells you the ticket is ready and offers to present it, and
"show me the draft" shows it at any point. It writes nothing to any system unless you ask it, in that
turn, to create the issue in a connected tracker.

**One stage at a time:**

```text
/himoa:gate-design <requirement>  →  /himoa:gate-approve  →  /himoa:gate-implement
/himoa:gate-review                →  /himoa:gate-validate
```

Implemented something by hand? Run `gate-review`, then `gate-validate`. Gates
are human-typed: on Claude Code the model cannot invoke one, and the
methodology forbids it from simulating one.

### Following a run

`work-item` prints a **pipeline ledger** — seven stages, exactly one marked in
progress — in its first response and again at every stage transition, after
your approval, and at the end. That block is where the run is; it is written
into the conversation, so it works on every model and on every Claude Code
build.

The same seven stages also tick in Claude Code's native task panel, because
`framework-install` sets `env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS` in the
repository's committed `.claude/settings.json` — from v2.1.233 those tools are
not given to current models unless a session opts in
([C21](constraints.md#c21--the-task-list-tools-are-not-provided-by-default-on-current-models)).
The ledger is the record; the panel is how you read the current stage without
scrolling back through the output.

If the panel stays empty, check three things in order. Is
`env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS` in the committed `.claude/settings.json`? If
not, re-run `framework-install` and commit. Is the plugin current? Claude Code
hands those tools over **deferred** rather than callable, and an old plugin
reads that as having no task list at all — update it; nothing on disk changes.
Is the key overridden in your own `.claude/settings.local.json`? The ledger is
unaffected either way, because it never depended on the panel.

To turn the panel off for yourself without changing it for the team, set the
key in `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is per developer and is not
committed.

The run also keeps a state file **outside** your repository, so a compacted
session can recover the approved scope and your conditions. Nothing is written
into your working tree except the approved diff; if you ever find a framework
state file inside the repository, that is a bug worth reporting.

### Picking work back up later

You can close the session and come back to an approved work item —
tomorrow, or after a restart. `claude --resume` restores the conversation; the
state file carries what the conversation cannot prove on its own.

What you should expect to see before anything is edited:

- **the repository checked before the plan is trusted.** A change to something
  unrelated does not invalidate an approved design. A change to a file the
  design was written about does, and the run says so and goes back to design
  rather than implementing over it.
- **your own words quoted back.** An approval is only ever the words you typed.
  If the run cannot find them, it asks you again — that is the correct
  behaviour, not a lost session.
- **your uncommitted work left alone.** A resumed run classifies changed files
  as its own, as pre-existing, or as unknown, and it never resolves *unknown*
  as its own. Nothing is reset, stashed or discarded in any of the three cases.

You do not have to do anything to enable this, and a work item you finish in one
sitting never touches it. **The state file is not a document about your project
and it is not something to commit** — it is scratch, it holds no source and no
secrets, and it is deleted when the run completes successfully.

## Updating the framework

```text
/plugin marketplace update jaylordibe
/plugin update himoa@jaylordibe
```

Then restart — an update does not apply to a running session, and hooks in
particular keep using the previous version's path until `/reload-plugins`.

With `autoUpdate` on the marketplace entry, which is what the installer writes,
**both commands are done for you**: Claude Code refreshes the catalogue and updates the installed plugin in
the background after a session starts, up to about ten minutes in. The new
version loads on your next launch, or after `/reload-plugins`. So the only thing
left is the restart.

An update **never** requires re-running `framework-install`, re-adding the
marketplace, or any action from colleagues who have not pulled yet. Your
repository contract is unaffected by a plugin update; it is already committed.

You receive a new version only when `version` in the plugin's manifest is
bumped. If the bump is **major**, read that entry in `CHANGELOG.md` before
updating — a major bump is defined as one where a consuming repository may have
to act. Minor and patch bumps never ask anything of you.

**Your repository records no framework version.** There is nothing to keep in
sync, and nothing that can go stale. Claude Code owns the installed version, the
cache and the update lifecycle; on a major bump, the CHANGELOG entry says
exactly what to do.

**On Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI or Copilot**, the plugin commands above do not
apply: re-run `himoa-<host>-install`, and `himoa-<host>-doctor` reports a stale
machine install. A re-run leaves an existing `AGENTS.md` bootstrap untouched —
see [platform capabilities](platform-capabilities.md).

## When to run `framework-doctor`

- after `framework-install`;
- after any change to `AGENTS.md`, especially its commands or high-risk paths;
- after a framework major version bump;
- when a review says something about your architecture that surprises you —
  the doctor verifies documentation claims against source, and a stale
  `AGENTS.md` is the most common cause.

## Turning things off

There is nothing to turn off. The framework ships no permission rules and no
hooks that gate a command, so it cannot block anything you were going to do.
The gates are human-invoked, so a stage you do not want simply is not run.

If something is blocking a command, it is your own `.claude/settings.json` or
your permission mode — not this plugin. See **The repository contract** above,
and the 1.0.0 entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| Skills or commands don't appear | Not installed, or the session predates the install. Re-check [the short version](#the-short-version) or [other agents](#using-this-repository-from-codex-cursor-copilot-or-gemini), then reload or restart. |
| Works for me, not for a teammate (Claude) | They need the per-machine `/plugin install`, not `framework-install`. The plugin doesn't travel with `git pull`. |
| `framework-doctor`: repository does not declare Himoa | Run `framework-install` (Claude) or `himoa-<host>-install --repo`, and commit the result. |
| Everything prompts for permission / a command is blocked | Not Himoa — it ships no permission rules. Check your own settings and permission mode. |
| An agent describes architecture you don't have | Your `AGENTS.md` is missing or stale. Fill it from evidence, run the doctor, then [open an issue](https://github.com/jaylordibe/himoa/issues) with the transcript. |
| The agent claims a gate ran that you didn't type (Claude) | It didn't run — gates cannot be model-invoked. The claim is the bug. |
| A non-Claude host doesn't reflect the methodology | Confirm `himoa-<host>-doctor` is green, and see the [adapter smoke test](adapter-smoke-test.md). |
| The task panel stays empty | See [Following a run](#following-a-run) — the ledger in the conversation is the record either way. |
