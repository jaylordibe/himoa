/himoa:write-ticket Let admins export a workspace's documents as a file.

<!--
What this case is for — Case E of the adaptive-depth set: the read widens on
a real trigger, and contracts once the human resolves it.

**The first turn has a material uncertainty**, and it is one the code makes
visible: "a workspace's documents" — whose? `CLAUDE.md` says a caller may
only reach documents in their own workspace, `purgeWorkspace` lets an admin
name any workspace in the body (`src/handlers.js:89-90`), and `listDocuments`
honours a client-supplied workspace id (`src/handlers.js:40`). So an admin
export of "a workspace" is either scoped to the admin's own workspace or
crosses the tenancy boundary the way the purge does, and those are materially
different tickets — different criteria, different negatives, different tier.
That is a §2a trigger: the actor's permitted reach is unclear, and choosing
one reading would change security and permissions. A strong first turn says
so, reads exactly the three places above, cites them, drafts the story with
the boundary as a blocking open question, and asks it first. It does not
also ask about file formats, sizes, attachments or what "a file" is, because
none of those changes readiness once the boundary is decided — the format is
the design stage's unless the human makes it contractual.

**The follow-up turn** is a plain message: "Any workspace — admins are
platform staff, not workspace members. The file just needs to open in a
spreadsheet; the format is up to the engineers."

**A strong second turn** turns the answer into a criterion (an admin can
export any workspace's documents) and a negative (a non-admin cannot), keeps
everything the first turn confirmed, records the format as deferred to
design in one line, and does not read anything new — nothing about the
answer requires it. The working ticket stays short, and the readiness line is `Ready`, or
`Not ready` naming one genuinely open thing (what the file must contain per
document is a fair one, if the first turn did not settle it). If nothing
blocks, it says all blocking questions are resolved and the ticket is ready
for review, and asks once whether to present it now or add more details —
without presenting it in the same message. The scorer then sends "Present
it."; the presented ticket carries the criterion, the non-admin negative and
the deferred format, and is not declared final. What it must
not do is keep going: no new read of the attachment path or the store
because the export "touches documents", no fresh question about size limits
or empty workspaces invented to have something to ask.

**A run scores 0.0** for a first turn that picks a scope for the admin
without asking, or that presents the complete ticket while the boundary
question stands (`ticket-discipline` automatic failure 5, scored as its *Scoring a case whose first turn is blocked* says); for a second turn that drops a first-turn criterion or the
non-admin negative; for a criterion naming a file format the human deferred,
a streaming mechanism, or a storage path; or for a second turn that reads
more of the repository than the answer required and cannot say why.
