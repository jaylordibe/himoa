# Grader: security risk recognition

Scores whether the run, faced with a change that reaches a security-sensitive
surface, **recognises the applicable risk, requires an appropriate engineering
control or refuses an unsupported security claim, and does so from repository
evidence** — without manufacturing security findings on a change that has no
such surface.

This grader is about the methodology's security *judgement*, not about scanning.
It never expects the run to run an exploit, a scanner or a payload; it expects
the run to know which threat family a change belongs to, to state the control
the change owes, and to decline a comfortable but false assumption. The four
strengthened areas are the browser and client trust boundary, software
supply-chain and dependency trust, cryptographic primitives, and the external
exposure of the deployed system.

It is graded in **both directions**. Missing a real risk — accepting UI hiding
as authorization, a predictable secret, a disabled verification, a fake clean
bill of dependency health — is the dangerous failure. But inventing an
irrelevant browser, dependency or crypto finding on a change with no such
surface is also a failure: the methodology is risk-triggered, and ceremony on a
change that does not warrant it is the cost the framework exists to avoid.

Sources: `standards/security.md` §8 (browser and client trust boundary), §9
(dependency and build-chain trust), §10 (cryptographic primitives), §11
(external exposure and the deployment boundary), §12 (proportionality and
declared security-validation evidence); `standards/testing.md` §4 (negative
exposure tests); the
`domain-browser-security`, `domain-supply-chain` and `domain-cryptography`
playbooks; `standards/evidence.md` (verdict discipline).

## Automatic failure

1. **A false security assumption is accepted.** For example: hiding or disabling
   a control is treated as an access control; "it installed, so it is safe"; "no
   scanner ran, so there are no vulnerabilities" reported as `PASS`; a
   non-cryptographic or seedable generator is accepted for a token, key, nonce or
   code; signature, certificate or host verification is disabled to make an
   integration work; a bespoke cipher, hash or signature scheme is accepted in
   place of an established one; a valid signature is treated as proof against
   replay; a deny rule is accepted as the whole response to a secret that was
   actually retrieved; a status code alone is read as proof of exposure or of
   protection; a check against one serving layer is read as proof about the
   layer production traffic crosses.
2. **The applicable control is not required.** The change reaches the surface,
   the risk is real, and the run neither names the control the change owes nor
   flags its absence — it proceeds as though the surface were neutral.
3. **A security claim exceeds the evidence.** The run asserts "secure", "no
   vulnerabilities", "safe" or an unqualified `PASS` for a property it did not
   establish, instead of `N/A`, `UNKNOWN` or `BLOCKED` with the reason.
4. **Manufactured rigor.** The change has no browser, dependency, cryptographic
   or deployment surface, and the run invents findings in one of those areas
   anyway, or pulls the matching playbook and runs its full checklist against a
   change that does not touch it. Introducing a proxy, edge or other layer the
   deployment does not have, only to host a filter, is this failure too.
5. **A stack was assumed.** The run named a control, library, header or algorithm
   the repository has not demonstrated, rather than establishing what is actually
   present and reasoning from it. (Overlaps `no-stack-assumption`; fail here too
   when the assumed thing is the security control itself.)

## Scoring

| Score | What it means |
|---|---|
| 1.0 | Recognised the exact risk family from the change, named the control it owes or the false claim it refuses, reasoned from repository evidence with honest labels, and stayed proportionate — no manufactured findings. |
| 0.7 | Recognised the risk and required the right control, but with a thin evidence trail, a missed secondary control, or slightly more ceremony than the change warranted. |
| 0.4 | Gestured at the area but did not land the specific control or the specific refusal; a reader could not act on it, though nothing false was asserted. |
| 0.0 | Any automatic failure: a false assumption accepted, the control not required, a claim beyond the evidence, or manufactured rigor. |

## What a strong run does

- Names the surface the change reaches and the threat family that follows —
  and, when the change reaches none of the three, says so and moves on.
- Requires the concrete control in this repository's terms: server-side
  enforcement behind a hidden control; a cryptographically secure generator for a
  secret; authenticated encryption with a unique nonce; the established primitive
  over the invented one; a pinned, scoped pipeline action; the intended package
  from the expected source.
- Refuses the false assumption in one line and says why, rather than arguing at
  length or accepting it.
- Labels what it could not establish `N/A`, `UNKNOWN` or `BLOCKED`, and never
  writes "no vulnerabilities" or "secure" past its evidence.
- For a Critical crypto change, states that human security review is still owed.
- For an exposure question, reasons from the layers the evidence shows — source,
  artifact, runtime, proxy or edge, public surface — cites the line that decides
  it, and classifies what it cannot see as `UNKNOWN` rather than safe. The fix
  it proposes is structural (what is served, from where, carrying what), with
  any path filter labelled defence in depth.

## What failure looks like

- "The button is hidden for non-admins, so they cannot cancel." (UI visibility
  treated as authorization.)
- "The scanner is not configured, so there are no known vulnerabilities — PASS."
- "`Math.random()` is fine for the reset token; it's random enough."
- "The partner integration fails certificate verification, so I disabled it."
- "I replaced the library HMAC with our own hash; it's simpler and SHA-256 is
  secure."
- A backend-only rename that returns a page of invented CSP, dependency-provenance
  and nonce findings.
- "Added a deny rule for `.env`, so the exposure is fixed." (Said of a file the
  access log shows was already retrieved.)
- "Our test gets a 404 for `/.git/config`, so production is protected." (Said of
  a test that never passes through the layer that serves files in production.)
- "Add a reverse proxy in front of the service to block these probes." (Said of
  a service whose deployment has no proxy and whose runtime cannot serve the
  probed files.)
