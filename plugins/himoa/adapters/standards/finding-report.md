# Finding report contract

Every review lens returns its report in this shape.

**A lens does not read this file to write its report.** The part of it a lens
needs at runtime is embedded in that lens's own definition, byte-identical, from
`@HIMOA_HOME@/standards/agent-runtime-contract.md`. This file is where
the shape is explained and argued — for a maintainer, for a gate reading a
report, and for an agent with a question its embedded contract genuinely leaves
open. Reaching it as a routine step is the acquisition that costs an
investigation the room its report needed.

**A report is two parts: one coverage line, then the findings table.** Nothing
else, in either direction — a lens that returns only the table has not said
where it has been, and one that returns prose around the table has returned
something the reader has to re-read the source to use. A lens whose own
definition names a deliverable of its own returns it between the two.

## When you stop investigating and start writing

`@HIMOA_HOME@/standards/execution-efficiency.md` §8 owns that decision
and states it in full. Three of its rules decide this report, and all three are
already in every lens's embedded contract — so what follows is the explanation,
not a step in a run:

- **Synthesis is part of this task, not what follows it.** The moment the
  question you were launched to answer is answerable from what you hold, the
  room that remains belongs to the report.
- **A bounded report carrying verified findings and explicit `UNKNOWN`s
  outranks an investigation that ran to its ceiling and returned nothing.** The
  second returns no evidence at all, and the reader has to establish from
  scratch what you already knew.
- **Continued after a partial run, synthesise rather than restart.** Fill only
  the gaps the assigned question turns on.

None of that licenses a short look. An investigation that stopped while there
was still something its answer depended on has under-investigated, and marking
that hole `UNKNOWN` does not convert it into one.

## The coverage line

One line or two, always — before the table, and before `No findings.` as well:

```text
Coverage — examined: <what you opened, in this repository's own words>;
not reached: <what your lens owns and did not establish>;
UNKNOWN: <each, with what would settle it> | none.
```

It is here because `No findings.` has two meanings and only one of them is
safe. A lens that established its controls and found nothing wrong, and a lens
that ran out of room before it looked, return the same three words — and
nothing in the report tells them apart. This line does.

It is also what keeps the reader's verification **targeted**. Whoever
commissioned this report re-opens the source behind any claim a decision rests
on — that is independent review and it does not go away. What it should not
have to do is repeat your investigation to work out where to look. `examined`
says where you have been; `not reached` says which part of your own remit is
still owed to somebody.

Keep it to a pointer. It is not a second report, and it never carries a
conclusion the table does not.

## The table

Return findings **only** in this table, most severe first. The coverage line
above it is the report's other half; nothing else appears in either.

| Severity | Confidence | `path:line` | Finding | Trigger | Impact | Minimal fix | Regression test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Severity

| Severity | Means |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Exploitable now, or destroys or corrupts data. Blocks the gate. |
| **High** | Wrong behaviour on a reachable path, or a security control that does not hold. Blocks the gate. |
| **Medium** | Wrong or fragile under conditions that will occur, but not on the common path. |
| **Low** | Real, small, and safe to fix later. |
| **Note** | Not a defect. Context the reviewer should have. |

Critical and High findings stop the work until they are resolved or refuted.

## Confidence

`High`, `Medium` or `Low`. **A Low-confidence finding must say what evidence
would settle it** — otherwise it is a worry the next reader cannot discharge.

## Every finding needs a trigger

State the concrete input, sequence or state that reaches the defect, and the
expected versus actual behaviour. A finding that cannot name a trigger is a
worry, not a defect, and belongs at `Note` or not at all.

## Every `path:line` is one you opened

A cited line you inferred from a search snippet is a **fabrication, not a
finding** — see `repository-evidence.md` §2. One fabricated citation costs the
reader their trust in every other row, including the correct ones.

**A citation is repository-relative.** `src/handlers.js:40`, not the absolute
path it happened to be read from — an absolute path is noise in a report, and it
carries the reader's directory layout into a pull-request body where it means
nothing to anyone else.

**Separate what the line says from what you concluded from it.** The citation
is the `FACT`; where the defect follows from the line rather than being written
on it, the step between them is an `INFERENCE` and belongs in the Trigger cell,
stated. A reader who can see which is which re-opens one file and settles the
row. A reader who cannot has to reconstruct your reasoning before they can
check it, and that is the whole investigation again.

## Zero findings is a valid result

**Returning no findings is expected and frequently correct.** Write the
coverage line, then `No findings.`, and stop. The coverage line appears either
way. Without it, this result is indistinguishable from a lens that never looked
at all.

Do not lower the bar to fill the table. Do not report a concern you could not
evidence. Do not restate the diff back as though describing it were a defect.

A short honest report is worth more than a padded one, because every invented
finding costs a verification cycle that a real one then does not get — and
because a lens that always finds something is a lens the reader learns to
discount.

## You are read-only

`disallowedTools` removes `Edit`, `Write` and `NotebookEdit` from every
framework agent. The main conversation verifies each finding against source and
owns every remediation. Propose the fix and the regression test; do not apply
either.
