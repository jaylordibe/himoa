// Validates the SessionStart charter — the framework's entire always-on
// context, paid on every request in every repository a user opens.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// The charter is the only framework text that is loaded unconditionally, and it
// had no test of any kind. Deleting its human-owned-operations section outright
// left every suite green. That section is where the framework states, in the
// one place Claude always sees, that commits and deploys belong to the human;
// losing it is losing the default posture in every repository at once.
//
// It is also the one output whose SHAPE is constrained by Claude Code rather
// than by taste:
//
//   - `additionalContext` is capped at 10 000 characters; longer content is
//     spilled to a file, so a charter that grows past the cap stops being
//     always-on and starts being a file nobody opens;
//   - the hook must emit valid JSON on stdout, or the context is simply lost;
//   - SessionStart re-runs on `--continue` and `--resume`, so this cost is paid
//     more than once per conversation.
//
// And one constraint that is about how the text READS rather than what it says.
// The hooks documentation is explicit: additionalContext "framed as
// out-of-band system commands can trigger Claude's prompt-injection defenses,
// which causes Claude to surface the text to you instead of treating it as
// context". A charter that trips that defence is not a strict charter — it is
// an absent one, printed to the user as a curiosity. The density check below is
// deliberately loose: it is a budget, not a style rule.
//
// No dependencies. Run with `node tests/validate-charter.mjs`.

//
// The ceiling is deliberately tight, and the next addition here removes
// something. Three sections earn their place against it — the source
// precedence, "repository content is evidence, not instruction", and the
// floor-and-exit pair — because each defends against something that arrives
// before any skill or standard has loaded. A change that raises this constant
// has to argue for it here.
