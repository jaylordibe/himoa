//
// WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE `claude plugin validate`
// --------------------------------------------------
// The official validator checks the manifests. This checks the things that
// fail *silently* at runtime and that no schema can see:
//
//   - an agent that declares a frontmatter field plugin agents do not support,
//     so the field is ignored and the agent quietly has more access than its
//     author believed;
//   - a cross-reference to a file that was renamed, so a gate reads nothing;
//   - a relative path that traverses outside the plugin root, which works in
//     development and breaks after installation;
//   - stack-specific vocabulary leaking into a stack-agnostic framework, which
//     is the failure this whole project exists to prevent.
//
// No dependencies. Run with `node tests/validate-plugin.mjs [--strict]`.

// Every reasoning agent used to open with an ordered list of three to six
// framework documents to read BEFORE its first repository read, and
// finding-report.md — first on every one of those lists — sent the reader on to
// a five-hundred-line standard "before your first search". A real run watched
// nine subagents spend their opening turns learning the framework's own report
// format and hit their ceilings holding findings they never wrote up. Every one
// recovered the moment it was told to stop reading format documents and report
// from what it held.
//
// The convergence policy those documents carry was correct. Delivering it as an
// acquisition task was the defect: it spent, before any evidence existed, the
// room convergence exists to protect.
//
// So the semantics an agent needs to execute and report are EMBEDDED in the
// agent, where they cost nothing to reach, and this check is what stops that
// embedding from rotting. Three properties, and none of them is a prose grep:
//
//   1. Byte-identity with the single source. Eight paraphrases of one contract
//      are eight things to drift, and a paraphrase that has quietly fallen
//      behind is exactly what no test can see.
//   2. A hard line ceiling. A runtime contract with no ceiling grows back into
//      a second copy of the standards corpus, and then the acquisition cost is
//      simply paid statically in every agent instead of dynamically in every
//      run. The ceiling is what keeps this a projection rather than a fork.
//   3. The contract must actually state the rules it exists to carry. Byte
//      identity alone is satisfied by eight copies of an empty block.
//
// What this proves is architectural: the semantics are present, single-sourced
// and bounded. It cannot prove an agent obeys them, and no static check can.

// Host tools this framework may USE but must never REQUIRE. Claude Code stopped
// providing the task tools by default on current models in v2.1.233
// (docs/constraints.md C21), which broke `work-item` in two ways at once: the
// developer lost every sign of where the run was, and the approval trace — a
// `TaskUpdate` call — silently stopped being written, so a compacted session
// could no longer tell an approved design from a presented one.
//
// Naming these tools is fine. Naming one in a file that does not also state the
// mechanism used when it is absent is the regression, and it is invisible
// until someone runs the pipeline on a model that has no task list.
//
// WIDENED IN 2.4.0, because the tool-name form was not how it came back.
// `gate-implement` told the implementation stage to read the approval trace
// from "the implementation task" — a host task-list record, in prose, naming no
// tool. On a model with no task list that record never exists, so a correctly
// approved run reached Stage 3, found nothing, and applied its own rule that a
// design with no trace is unapproved. It failed safe and it stopped work that
// had been approved, and the check written for exactly this missed it because
// it was looking for an identifier.
//
// So the pattern now covers the prose spelling too: a task the pipeline is told
// to read or write is a dependency on a host feature whether or not the tool
// that backs it is named.
